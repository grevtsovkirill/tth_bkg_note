\subsection{Samples}

The simulated sample for \ttW production was generated using the \textsc{Sherpa}~2.2.1~\cite{sherpa} generator with the NNPDF3.0 NLO PDF set.
The matrix element (ME) was calculated for up to one additional parton at NLO and up to two partons at LO using
\textsc{Comix}~\cite{Gleisberg:2008fv} and \textsc{OpenLoops}~\cite{Cascioli:2011va}, and merged with the \textsc{Sherpa} parton shower~\cite{Schumann:2007mg} using the \textsc{MePs@Nlo} prescription~\cite{Hoeche:2012yf}.
The choice of renormalisation and factorisation scales is $\mu_R = \mu_F = H_\textrm{T}$/2, where $H_\textrm{T}$ is defined as the scalar sum of the transverse masses $\sqrt{p_\textrm{T}^2+m^2}$ of all final state particles.
