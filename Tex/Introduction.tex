\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The search for Higgs boson production in association with a top quark pair ($t\bar{t}H$) in the $\mathrm{H\rightarrow bb}$~\cite{HIGG-2017-03} and $\mathrm{H\rightarrow}$ multi-lepton~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2019-045} final states is limited by the modelling uncertainties of the main backgrounds, $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ and $t\bar{t}W$ respectively. %, where V denotes either a W or Z boson. 
Examples of tree-level diagrams of said processes are shown in Figure~\ref{intro:sig}. A comparison of available Monte Carlo generators is thus performed to study modelling differences. Comparisons of observables are made at particle level, in a phase space similar to the reference measurements. Differences in the object and event selection were made to define a common selection with the CMS collaboration, to later compare these distributions between the two experiments. The goal is to decide on a common strategy between ATLAS and CMS for background modelling uncertainties in the $t\bar{t}H(bb)$ and $t\bar{t}H$(multi-lepton) analyses.
