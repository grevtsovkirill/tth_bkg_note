\AtlasAbstract{%
This note presents Monte Carlo generator comparisons of the $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ and $t\bar{t}W$  processes at particle level. The aim is to compare the modelling of some important backgrounds and the treatment of the associated theory uncertainties for a full Run-2 ATLAS+CMS combination. As a first step, pre-fit modelling and theory uncertainties as used in the experiments are compared in the relevant analysis regions.%Observables which are expected to be sensitive to differences in the generators or sensitive to the signal versus background discrimination in the respective ttH(bb) or ttH(multi-lepton) analyses are shown.
